## README summary
The 100commitów project, undertaken as part of the [100commitów 2024 edition](https://100commitow.pl/), aims to develop a .NET-based application named ReceiptAnalyzer. This application is designed to analyze Polish fiscal receipts through images or scans, extracting valuable data such as seller information, product details, and transaction summaries. Despite progress in designing the application, setting up Azure infrastructure, implementing component communication, and initial machine learning model training for receipt recognition, the project faced delays due to personal and family reasons. Future enhancements are planned to improve data sets and model accuracy. The tech stack includes .NET 8, Azure Service Bus, and SQL Server, focusing on microservices architecture and machine learning with ML.NET. The project highlights the importance of thorough problem analysis and flexibility to manage unforeseen delays.

Być konsekwentnym 

## README summary
The "Faint Comments" project is a proof-of-concept tool designed for developers who wish to keep code comments separate from the source code file. This can be useful for reasons such as preventing comments from appearing in version control, needing to remove comments for production deployments, or providing instructional notes that can be managed separately. The library works by extracting comments from the code and storing them in a JSON file, which can then be reapplied to the code when needed. The tool is built on the TreeSitter parsing library and currently supports Python. It can be installed via pip and offers two main commands: one for extracting comments and another for rejoining them to the code. The project is under active development, with numerous planned features and improvements to enhance functionality and user experience.
